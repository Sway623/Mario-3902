Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
The fields naming and types are very clear and explanatory. The methods are all quite simple and spread out based on their function. This 
makes the class cohesive and maintainable.
However there do appear to be some magic numbers that could have been defined either inside the methods or at the top of the class.
