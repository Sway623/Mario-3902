Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: This file is fairly readable. It is a little lengthy which makes it
slightly difficult to follow, and the large branching statements are a bit confusing to read through. For example it is slightly difficult
to read through an if-else if-else if-else especially when the conditions are with comparison operators. Overall, I think this
file is pretty easy to read.
