Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: The naming of methods is clear, which makes the class readable. I can easily tell what method does what job. The naming of variables is clear as well. The author differentiate variables by add initials such as initPosition. This is a good practice. Overall, the readability of this class is pretty good.
