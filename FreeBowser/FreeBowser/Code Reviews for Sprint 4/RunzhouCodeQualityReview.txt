Specific comments on code quality: I think Jordan's code is of high quality. 

The only place that this class has been used is in the initializaSprites method in 
worldManager.cs and it is made a static class. Its unique functionality that controls camera makes it loose coupling when comparing with other classes.
Also with in the classes. Though there are many methods, regarding their functionality, I would say it's reasonable to have that many methods
and they are all related to the functionality of a camera controller. So this class still has considerablely high cohesion.
Combined with factors that this class is of high cohesion and loose coupling, thus I would say the code quality is good.
