Sprint number: 4

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: The function of this file is very clear.
There is a constructor to create the handler and a method ApplyGravityToMario() that gets the current velocity of Mario
and checks if his current velocity is less than or equal to 3. If it is, then the velocity of Mario is incremented by 0.5.
The only issue I see with this file is the empty else statement following the if-statement within ApplyGravityToMario().
Additionally, it seems like a vast amount of the actual handling of gravity is within CollisionChecker.
This might impact the readability of the CollisionChecker class, and should be looked into before the end of Sprint 4.
