Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: The file is very readable. This file takes
the content that used to be loaded in game and puts it in one conveneient place. It adds all items, players,
pipes, etc. into proper lists and then in Update and Draw it uses foreach loops to update and draw each
object. It also initilizes all the sprites by calling the sprite generator factory. All of this is very readable
and clear which is highlighted by clear method names and variable names.
