Sprint number: 4
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: Fireball.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Samer Abusway
Specific comments on code quality: 

The quality of this code is pretty decent. The variables used throughout are mostly clear and are only defined if they are absolutely necessary to the class.
The update method is somewhat longer than the others, and so it could potentially be cut down in places to more clearly explain what is happening and to
increase its overall cohesion. However, the entire class is not very long and all of its content deals with specifically the fireballs.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

One possible change could be if there were an ammo system, meaning mario could only fire a specific amount of fireballs per life, or some other 
restriction in that sense, then this file might need some maintenance done to support that change, and it is possible it could be difficult to include.
