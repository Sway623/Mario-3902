MarioGravityHandler2 has stayed nearly the same since the last review. However, creating a new variable called newVelocity
and doing nothing with it but assigning the currentVelocity to it and using it for comparisons/assignments is unnecessary.
In addition, the use of the ApplyGravityToMario() method has greatly improved. Earlier, I believe it was used in nearly
every Mario state class, in addition with various checks in each state like if Mario was grounded or supported.
This gravity logic has been primarily extracted to the main Mario class. I think the current implementation and use
of the Mario gravity handler is great. However, it should be noted that there are still a few bugs with gravity.
