Specific comments on code quality: One code smell in this class is that it is fairly long and has a lot of branching
statements. (This doesn't mean it is low quality). Other than that, the code seems very cohesive.
The class only does one thing and that is to control mario's velocity when he is moving left and right, which is a 
good quality to have. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change: If we wanted to change the numbers of veloocity or acceleration,
this class makes it very easy to do that. Versus having to dig through many classes, we have all the information about
mario's velocity in one place.
