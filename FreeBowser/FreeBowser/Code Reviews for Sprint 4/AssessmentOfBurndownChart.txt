We as a team do not think that our burn down chart progress improved from last sprint, and may have even worsened. However,
due to the fact that spring break was right in the middle of this sprint, we can't say that our jagged graph with a 
large stagnation in the middle is a surprise. Some of us were out of town, and others just needed a break.

I think that had spring break not been in the middle of the sprint, our progress would have looked much better on 
a graph. We worked very hard as a team and didn't wait til the last minute to do any of the refactoring. We started
working on refactoring actually right after turning in the initial implementation. I think that was the best thing 
that we did over this sprint. Hopefully we will be able to improve next sprint since there won't be a break in the middle.
