Specific comments on code quality: I think this code is very high quality. The class does only one thing which is very modular
and good. Its very readable and maintainable because it implements an interface IMarioState that would allow us to 
implement more functionality very easily.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could 
or could not easily support that change: It is really difficult to find something I would change about this code because
I think it's very simple and probably could not be improved by much. One hypothetical change we could make is to make the
field "marioSprite" just "sprite" because the field "state" is just that and not "marioState".
