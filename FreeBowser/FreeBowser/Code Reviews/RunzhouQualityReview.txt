Specific comments on code quality: Generally speaking, the code quality of the fireflower class is good. 
It is easily maintained because of the loose coupling characteristic. Other class only call this class when it is necessary and vice versa.
The quality of this code is good because inner the class, all methods are of high cohesion. Every mehtods perform their own task.
