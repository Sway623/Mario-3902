Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

A concern I have with this class and the other block classes is their creation.
Currently, the creation of blocks is manageable within Game1.cs because only 5 blocks exist. 
However, with the current implementation, when levels are created we would have to declare possibly 100s of block variables. 
I think some encapsulation between Game1.cs and the block classes would be useful. 

Another potential improvement is adding states to blocks to separate later logic from animation. 
This will help reduce / prevent reassigning blocks like QuestionBlock to Used block.
I think it would be very useful if there was a function for a power block to take on other appearances so they can be hidden / invisible.
