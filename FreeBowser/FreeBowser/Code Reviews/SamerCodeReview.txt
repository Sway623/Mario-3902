Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: Very readable. I liked the modular
approach. It was good to have methods that only did one thing, and since each method only has one line,
of course it only does one thing. It was also good to have the methods take no parameters so client side
doesn't have to know the arguments to pass. Overall very readable.
