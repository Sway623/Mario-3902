Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: The function of this file is very clear.
This file and its functionality has obviously been refactored several times. 
The only function in this file is CheckFireballCollisions, each fireball that currently exists is checked for
collisions against blocks, koopas, goombas, pipes, and pipes. In each loop, a fireball and the object to be checked against
is passed to the general collision detector. The general collision detector in each case returns the direction of the collision.
The direction of the collision is then passed to the appropriate handler, there is a separate handler for each type of collision.
Krishna did a great job with the readability of this file.
