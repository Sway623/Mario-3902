Specific comments on code quality: 

Though the quality of code for the level 1 file is hard to evaluate, it seems that its quality is overall pretty good. We could use
the same format to create any variety of levels or to modify the current level. 



A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change:

A hypothetical change we could make is adding more complex items or enemies, but I still think that this sort of implementation
could fairly easily support a change as such. For example, adding a red koopa would be as simple as creating a key for it and then
adding the value of the red koopa to the dictionary of keys.
