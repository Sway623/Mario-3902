Specific comments on code quality: I think Jordan's code is of high quality. 

The only place that this class has been used is when mario has no lifes . Its unique functionality that ends game makes it loose coupling when comparing with other classes.
Also within the classes. Though there are many methods, regarding their functionality, I would say it's reasonable to have that many methods
and they are all related to the functionality of game over. So this class still has considerablely high cohesion.
Combined with factors that this class is of high cohesion and loose coupling, thus I would say the code quality is good.
