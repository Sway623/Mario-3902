Sprint number: 5
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: BlockGravityHandler.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Sophie DeRosa
Specific comments on code quality: 

This code has both high cohesion and loose coupling. This class only knows of the block class on which
it must operate (gravity). Instead of modifying concrete fields, this class uses methods within the block
class to set velocities and determine whether the block is moving up. This class deals only with the block
gravity and knows onlhy of that class. 



A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change:

A hypothetical change would be to make the block move up a little bit more before it falls. This would serve
no real purpose besides a change in anaimation but the current implementation would be capable of adopting this 
change rather easily because it handles the up and down movement of the block already.
