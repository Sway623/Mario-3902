Specific comments on code quality: I think that this class is very quality. Each method is very modular and only attempts
to do one thing, such as LoadSoundContent which does only that thing which the method header describes.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change: One thing that we could change (and this relates to how we are 
supposed to be building a game engine vs. a game) is to change the actual music files, where we might be changing
the entire theme of the game and would need new music. This would be very easy to do as all we would need is to
load the new files and appropriately change when they are played (or, we might not even need to change that).
