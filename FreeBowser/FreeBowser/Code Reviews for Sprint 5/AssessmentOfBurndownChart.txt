We as a team do not think that our burndown chart progress was the worst compared to all the other sprints. However,
the first half of our burndown chart is almost completely linear. However, team members kept finding additional features that needed to be added or 
fixed throughout the second half of the project. The team felt that adding additional tasks to the backlog was more important than
trying to maintain a linear burndown chart. Additionally, the work done during this project was fairly consistent, however the addition of tasks several times
counteracted any work done a given day.

A large factor in the poor appearance of the second half of our burndown chart is trying to complete tasks that should have been finished the sprint before.
Rather than perfecting certain functionalities when they were first assigned, much debugging happened during Sprint 5 and took away time from
the initially planned features of Sprint 5. The sprint burndown chart for Sprint 6 will be interesting, 
given that everyone will be independently working on their own additions.
