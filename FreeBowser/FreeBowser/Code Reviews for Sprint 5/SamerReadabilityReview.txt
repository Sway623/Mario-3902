Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: ApplyGravityToBlock() is a readable method. It clearly
adds to the vertical velocity to have a gravitational effect on the block. It checks to see if it's moving up or 
down and acts appropriately and then sets the velocity appropriately. It changes the block to be moving down
once velocity reaches a certain threshold. Very readable.
