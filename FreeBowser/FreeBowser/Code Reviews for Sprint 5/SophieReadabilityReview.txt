Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: This file is super readable. There is a loading method in
which all the specific sound files are loaded. Then there are methods to play a certain sound and another method which
I am actually not really sure what it does. That method may need some better documentation or explanation of why it 
is different than the first method. Otherwise it looks good and I can read through it very easily.
