Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
The update method has logic that is not initially clear to a third party as to what exactly is happening.
I think overall the method can be pieced together when investigating other methods being called, but initially
it is not 100% clear. I believe it is a bit difficult to differentiate between what is being done between the 
the state machine, the sprite, and the state sprite, but upon further investigation it is evident that each class
does specific things as related to the Goomba enemy. So related to this, in an ideal world, it would be clearer
what every class was doing a priori, but I think it's fine to just have the methods called as needed. Overall,
I believe that most of the class is easy to follow and the logic is clear.
