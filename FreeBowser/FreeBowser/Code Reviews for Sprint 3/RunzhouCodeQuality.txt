Specific comments on code quality: I think Jordan's code is of high quality. 

The only place that this class has been used is in the initializaSprites method in 
Game.cs. Its unique functionality makes it loose coupling when comparing with other classes.
Also with in the classes. Since there is only method parse, it is of high cohesion.
Combined with factors that this class is of high cohesion and loose coupling, thus the code quality is high.
This class is also reusable.
