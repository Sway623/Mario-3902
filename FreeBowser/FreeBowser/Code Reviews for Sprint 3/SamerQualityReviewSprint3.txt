Specific comments on code quality: I believe this code is of high quality. The code relies on other classes
to handle most of the methods - i.e. goombaState and goombaSprite. It makes the client side Goomba code very
easily managed, with a modular implementation on the back end. This class is cohesive, only making changes
to one element of the game - the goomba enemy. Initially, this implementation did not use a state pattern,
but now using the state pattern makes the code much more maintainable. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change: A hypothetical change to the file would be to
use a state machine as previously used for this code. We had it working with a state machine, but the code
is less maintainable and readable with a state machine for this particular element of the game. The current 
implementation could easily support the change, I believe it's a matter of choice. But this option of state
pattern is easier to maintain.
