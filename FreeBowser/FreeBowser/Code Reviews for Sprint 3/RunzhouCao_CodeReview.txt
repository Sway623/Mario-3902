Sprint number: 3 

Name of the .cs file being reviewed CSVParser.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Jordan Linville
Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 15 minutes

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

The naming of variables is pretty good. The naming of positions and sprite parameters is readable.
Also it is a good practice to keep local variables in the loop where they might be used instead of declare as member variables.
 
Before I review this .cs file, I have no intel about what a CSV parser is. But I can easily figure what does the method function. 
Even though there are nested loops, the author made it simple and clear to recognize its fuctionality. 

I would say it would be better if the author names the magic number 600.
