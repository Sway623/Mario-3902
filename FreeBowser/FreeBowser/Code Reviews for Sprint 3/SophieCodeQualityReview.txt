Specific comments on code quality: I think that this code is high quality. The Handler only covers one 
total situation - when an enemy and a mario collide. Since it only does one thing I think the code is
modular which we consider to be high quality. I think the handler has high cohesion because every 
element in the handler (meaning each if statement) contributes to the same thing - i.e. handling 
an enemy and mario collision.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change: The only thing that does not immediately
seem intuitive is that the handler checks the health of koopa before taking action but does not check
the health of goomba. Joe and I discussed this and I think our current implementation is supposed to
be set up this way, but I think that the code would be more robust to make some changes in the way
that we check Goomba health. The current implementation could easily change this.
