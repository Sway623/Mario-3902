Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

I would say that keys used to represent objects in the level are fairly readable. It is easy to discern what each key stands for,
be it a block, an enemy, a background object, or an item.

I would say that the most confusing thing in the file is the formatting, more specifically that each row of the file ends at a different spot, 
however I understand that adding in spaces to format the file may make it more difficult to parse, so it is acceptable but could be improved.
