Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
The functionality of collision checker is clear. 
Every block (static object) is rectangle is checked against against every enemy's rectangle (Koopas and Goombas). 
Then every player (mario) object is compared every kind of block, pipe, and item for collisions.
Then every player (mario) object is also compared against every koopa and goomba for collisions.
While it is clear what is being checked for collisions, the order why is not clear.
I suggest comparing every static object against every dynamic object and every
dynamic object against every dynamic object. Currently it has a "mix and match" format.
