Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: There is quite a bit of branching in this handler, which does make it a bit
difficult to read through. For the most part it is intuitive. It is easy to read through which cases give which results. For example
it is easy to read that for a top collision, a goomba and mario collision will yield in mario damage.
