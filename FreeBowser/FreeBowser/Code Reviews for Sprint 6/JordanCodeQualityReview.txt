Sprint number: 6 
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: MarioTakingDamageAnimationManager.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Krishna Ganesan
Specific comments on code quality: 

The code quality of this file is high, but it is also a very short file. The only function in the manager has a very specific functionality.
However, the layout of variables used seems a bit odd. Everytime the method is called, it will declare variables that may be frequently used.
It might be a better choice to move those variables, but it could also be argued that since they are centric to the animation,
they belong there.


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change:

If we implemented a method to change mario's state, sprite, etc. (without sound) I think the current implementation would support that change
and benefit from it. Krishna has done a good job with separating this logic from the already very large mario class.
