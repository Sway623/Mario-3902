Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

I believe the code is overall readable. The update method could definitley use some comments to explain
what is going on, but since comments are discouraged, tracing through every line of code it is clear what 
is going on. Long code blocks just made it a little harder to look at. Besides that, everything is clear
and readable. Methods are well named as are variables.
