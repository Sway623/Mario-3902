Specific comments on code quality: I think this is a high quality file. The Update() method only updates the key
mappings (which commands have been pressed and which haven't) so it is a cohesive method. The methods in the class
all seem to go together which means overall there is high cohesion, which is good.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change: If we were to add more commands to the game, there would need to be
some changes made to the hardcoded commands in the LogCommandsMappings. That would not be difficult at all to implement 
based on the way that the class is set up.
