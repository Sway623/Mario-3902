Specific comments on code quality: I think Jordan's code is of high quality. 

Although there are many methods, they are all related to Edit Level's fuctionality. So I would say this is unavoidable and it still can be viewed as high cohesion.
It's reasonable to have that many methods.

But the coupling is tight. The class has many static fields, which means many other classes will depend on this class. Again, I would say this is unavoidable
because of its functionality.
