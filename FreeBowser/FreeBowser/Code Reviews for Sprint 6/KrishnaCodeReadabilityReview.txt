Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

I would say that this file has okay readability. I believe I understand that the objective is to create enemies at random locations over the period of time in the game. 
However, some of the variable names could benefit from more specific names, and the conditional logic could probably explain why it is needed as well. 
All in all, this is a very simple file so it has high cohesion and comprehensibility.
