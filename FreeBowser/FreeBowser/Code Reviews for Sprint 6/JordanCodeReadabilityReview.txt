Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

This file is far more readable than the last time I reviewed/went through it. 
Krishna has eliminated almost all of the magic numbers he used and it is now clear what transitions are happening at certain
frame counts, and why. The only thing that might not be "readable" is the long if statement, a switch statement
might be more appealing here because the same variable is being checked every single time for another condition.
