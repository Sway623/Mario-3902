Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: This file has a lot of fields at the top which is slightly
hard to read. The constructor is easy to read and understand and everything has been named appropriately. The other 
methods are also fairly readable. There also is some commented out code at the bottom which I would consider 
hard to read.
