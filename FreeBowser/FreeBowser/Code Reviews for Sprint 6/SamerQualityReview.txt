Specific comments on code quality: The class is very long yet still cohesive because it is all related to 
the goomba class. Coupling isn't too terribly high. This class knows about both the sprite and the state, but 
this is because these two things are what encompass a goomba object. This class takes care of calling the
appropriate methods in the appropriate classes to do what is necessary, while keeping things simple on the client 
side.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change: One could argue that the nightmare logic should be separated into
a different class. One could check in the update method if nightmare mode is activated and then defer to another 
class, and this would shorten the length of the class and increase cohesion, and the current implementation would
easily support this change, however it is a bit unnecessary because the nightmare logic does not take up
a lot of space in the class.
