Sophie's feature: The feature I worked on was Nightmare Mode. In order to activate Nightmare Mode, press the "n" key
at the beginning of the level. During nightmare mode, enemies that are killed will come back to haunt mario as a ghost.
I implemented special sprites for both nightmare goomba and nightmare koopa. The nightmare koopa does not create a shell
after being killed (intentionally). The goomba and koopa both need to be killed again after coming back as a ghost.

Krishna's Feature: Naturally, since I have always been a fan of video games, as well as quite skilled in them, I wanted to 
include a slightly more challenging mode. What I produced was a "Jump Only Mode", activated/deactivated by pressing the "j" key.
In this mode, the player only has control of mario's jumping/vertical movement, and he will always be forced to move to the right
progressing through the level. This way, you really have to time your jumps well or else you will surely be killed over and
over by enemies of even falling through the floor. 

Samer's feature: The feature I worked on was an Enemy Spawner mode. In order to activate Enemy Spawner mode,
press the "P" key at any point, and enemies will begin to spawn on the screen. Enemies will appear from thin air 
and try to attack Mario. This makes the game much more difficult to complete.

Runzhou's feature: I added a record and replay system to mario. 
I used the record system to record one game that I played :)And H key is pressed, the game will display exactly every steps of that game.

Jordan's feature: I added a custom level creator. Press L to begin the process.
You can cycle through the different sprites available by clicking the text at the top left.
Ex. Clicking on "Blocks", will bring up the next set of sprites.
You can move the sprites by moving your cursor against the direction you want to move the sprite.
In order to save a level, click "save level" at the top and type a file name and hit enter. 
You will have to restart the game if you wish to play your new level. 
The load level option will allow you to load any levels inside the Debug/Levels folder, where the created files are saved.
In addition, you can control the camera using the arrows keys.

The system will record the last game replay into WriteLog.txt. If I have time I will add an replay selecting interface 
to let user choose what replay they want to see.
