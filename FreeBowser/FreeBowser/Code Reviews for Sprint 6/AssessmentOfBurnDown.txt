This burn down chart was a little different than in previous sprints. The burndown chart of this sprint 6 had an 
interesting spike about less than halfway through the sprint, which is probably because we set a goal to have all of our
bugs worked out from the last sprint by halfway through this sprint. We did actually learn something from our work
in the last sprint, and we acted upon it which I think was a great thing for our team.

In addition, we did have a lot of work getting done at the last minute like we usually did. There was a lot of code
getting pushed on Friday, and our team worked extremely hard to get this sprint done and make our new features really 
cool. We did not set forth any unrealistic expectations for ourselves and thus this may have been one of our 
best sprints yet.
