Jordan's code is a little bit unreadable
Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
The naming of variables is clear and I can understand what they are about according to their names. However there are too many 
variables, so I can't remember them all. The naming of methods is clear as well. Like InitXXX, I immediately understand
what the functionality is. What's more, the loops/foreach and if statements are clear and organized very well.
