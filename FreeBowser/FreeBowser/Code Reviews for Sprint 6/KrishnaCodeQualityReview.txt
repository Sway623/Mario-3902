Sprint number: 6 
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: EnemySpawner.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Samer Abusway
Specific comments on code quality: 

I would say that the code quality for this file is pretty good. First of all, it is very short and has only the methods that it needs. 
Also all of the logic inside update is very cohesive as it does deal with the sole function of updating the world's enemies. 
 


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change:

Currently, the way this class is structured it does not generate enemies randomly, but rather conditionally. If it was desired to have a random number of goombas produced
at various times (instead of fixed times), it would require some maintenance.
